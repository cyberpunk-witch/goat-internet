# goat-internet
just a silly idea inspired by the goat internet floppies from the Obvious Plant meme. A hobby project. 
unfinished, likely to remain unfinished indefinitely

the vague goal would be to make a gopher-like protocol called goat, and get the goat browser to render goat:// pages by parsing the url "goat://<someaddress>" to "https://<someaddress>:75" (port subject to change, I'm not sure which one is good to use. 70 is gopher, 80 is typical webpages). 

I don't think there's a functional 'reason' for a goat:// protocol (I'm not even sure how it should be different yet), but I reasoned that if the goat internet is supposed to be a special secret internet, making it a separate protocol so that it existed in a 'space' a bit like gopherspace made some kind of ...goaty sense. 

Probably also there should be something which makes the pages goats-only. Maybe some kind of security. Or maybe the browser will be locked, unless you put in the password 'goat'. Goats, while apparently secretive aren't necessarily great at security, or whatever.
